## üîß **Practical Configuration Examples**

### Small Server Setup (1-20 players)

```yaml
# Optimized for smaller communities
performance:
  chase-check-interval: 10
  wanted-check-interval: 120
  
chase:
  max-concurrent: 2
  max-duration: 180
  
contraband:
  grace-period: 15
  
database:
  type: "sqlite"
  
duty-banking:
  conversion-rate: 60      # Faster progression
  minimum-conversion: 180  # Lower barrier
```

### Large Server Setup (100+ players)

```yaml
# Optimized for high-population servers
performance:
  chase-check-interval: 5
  wanted-check-interval: 30
  async-operations: true
  cache:
    player-data: true
    cache-size: 2000
    
chase:
  max-concurrent: 10
  max-duration: 300
  
database:
  type: "mysql"
  mysql:
    pool:
      maximum-pool-size: 20
      minimum-idle: 5
      
duty-banking:
  conversion-rate: 120     # Slower progression
  minimum-conversion: 600  # Higher barrier for balance
```

### Roleplay Server Setup

```yaml
# Enhanced realism and immersion
guard-system:
  immobilization-time: 10   # Longer duty changes for realism
  shift-system:
    enabled: true
    
wanted-system:
  max-wanted-level: 10      # More granular threat levels
  levels:
    # Custom 10-level system with detailed descriptions
    
contraband:
  grace-period: 20          # More realistic search time
  enhanced-descriptions: true
  
jail:
  realistic-sentences: true
  base-time: 900           # Longer base sentences
```

### High-Security Prison Setup

```yaml
# Maximum security configuration
wanted-system:
  max-wanted-level: 5
  auto-escalation:
    enabled: true
    strict-penalties: true
    
chase:
  max-distance: 50         # Tighter chase limits
  no-chase-zones: []       # No safe zones except spawn
  
contraband:
  auto-scan-zones:
    - "all_areas"          # Scan everywhere
  enhanced-detection: true
  zero-tolerance: true
  
regions:
  lockdown-capable: true
  emergency-protocols: true
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration Validation**

### Config Checker Commands

```bash
# Validate configuration
/corrections config validate

# Check specific sections
/corrections config check guard-system
/corrections config check database

# Test database connection
/corrections config test-database

# Reload configuration
/edenreload
```

### Common Configuration Errors

```yaml
# WRONG - Invalid region name
duty-region: "guard station"    # Spaces not allowed in region names

# CORRECT - Valid region name  
duty-region: "guard_station"

# WRONG - Invalid time format
max-duration: "5 minutes"       # Must be in seconds

# CORRECT - Numeric seconds
max-duration: 300

# WRONG - Invalid color format
colors:
  primary: "purple"             # Must be hex color

# CORRECT - Hex color format
colors:
  primary: "#9D4EDD"
```

### Migration Guide

**Updating from v1.x to v2.0**:
```yaml
# Backup your old config.yml first!
# Run the migration command:
# /corrections migrate config

# New v2.0 features that need configuration:
performance:          # New performance section
  cache: {}

integration:          # New integration options
  gui: {}
  npc: {}

advanced-features:    # New advanced features
  analytics: {}
  automation: {}
```
