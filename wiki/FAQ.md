### Q: How do guards earn off-duty time?
**A:** Guards earn off-duty time through:
- **Base time**: 30 minutes after 15 minutes of duty
- **Performance bonuses**: Searches, arrests, detections
- **Continuous duty**: 2 minutes per hour on duty
- **Combat bonuses**: Eliminations while on duty

### Q: Can guards go off duty anywhere?

### Q: How long do wanted levels last?
**A:** By default, wanted levels last 30 minutes. This can be configured in the config.yml file under `times.wanted-duration`.

### Q: Can admins set custom wanted levels?
**A:** Yes, admins can use `/corrections wanted set <player> <level> [reason]` to set any wanted level from 1-5 with custom reasons.

### Q: What happens when a wanted player is arrested?
**A:** When arrested:
- Wanted level is cleared
- Jail time is calculated based on wanted level
- Statistics are updated
- Guard receives performance bonus

### Q: Can guards chase players in safe zones?
**A:** Chases automatically end when the target enters a safe zone (no-chase zone). This provides balanced gameplay mechanics.

### Q: What is the combat timer and how does it work?
**A:** The combat timer:

**A:** If a player fails to surrender contraband within the time limit, their wanted level automatically increases by 1.
