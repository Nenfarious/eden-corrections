### Rank Progression

```
Trainee ‚Üí Private ‚Üí Officer ‚Üí Sergeant ‚Üí Captain ‚Üí Warden
```

**Progression Requirements**:

## üîß **Duty Toggle System**

### Going On Duty

#### Process Flow
1. **Location Check** - Must be in guard station region
2. **Rank Detection** - LuckPerms group validation
3. **Requirement Verification** - Combat, wanted status checks
4. **Immobilization Period** - 5-second countdown with movement restriction
5. **Activation** - Inventory stored, kit given, duty status activated

#### Requirements
- Valid guard rank in LuckPerms
- Must be in guard station region
- Cannot be in combat
- Cannot be wanted
- Cannot already be on duty

#### Command
```bash
/duty
```

### Going Off Duty

#### Process Flow
1. **Restriction Check** - Cannot be in chase or combat
2. **Time Validation** - Must have earned off-duty time
3. **Region Check** - Must be in valid off-duty region
4. **Deactivation** - Inventory restored, duty time calculated
5. **Statistics Update** - Performance metrics saved

#### Requirements
- Must be on duty
- Cannot be in active chase
- Cannot be in combat
- Must have earned off-duty time
- Must be in valid off-duty region

## üéÆ **Performance Tracking System**

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Bonus Trigger |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Searches** | Contraband requests initiated | Every 10 searches |
| **Successful Searches** | Contraband found | Immediate bonus |
| **Arrests** | Completed jail processes | Immediate bonus |
| **Kills** | Combat eliminations | Every 5 kills |
| **Detections** | Positive drug tests | Immediate bonus |
| **Duty Time** | Continuous service | Hourly bonus |

### Performance Bonuses

#### Base Off-Duty Time
```yaml
# Default configuration
base-duty-requirement: 15    # minutes
base-off-duty-earned: 30     # minutes
```

**Earning Process**:
1. Guard goes on duty
2. Serves minimum 15 minutes
3. Automatically earns 30 minutes of off-duty time
4. Can go off duty and use earned time

#### Search Performance
```yaml
searches-per-bonus: 10       # searches needed
search-bonus-time: 5         # minutes earned
successful-search-bonus: 10  # minutes for positive result
```

**Example**:
- 10 contraband searches = 5 minutes bonus
- 1 successful search = 10 minutes bonus
- Total: 15 minutes additional off-duty time

#### Arrest Performance
```yaml
successful-arrest-bonus: 8   # minutes per arrest
```

**Triggers**:
- Completing jail countdown
- Successfully arresting wanted player
- Proper use of arrest procedures

#### Combat Performance
```yaml
kills-per-bonus: 5          # kills needed
kill-bonus-time: 15         # minutes earned
```

**Considerations**:
- Only counts legitimate guard vs criminal combat
- Guard vs guard combat doesn't count
- Must be on duty when kill occurs

#### Detection Performance
```yaml
successful-detection-bonus: 10  # minutes per detection
```

**Triggers**:
- Positive drug test results
- Successful contraband detection
- Proper use of detection tools

#### Time-Based Bonuses
```yaml
duty-time-bonus-rate: 2     # minutes per hour
```

**Automatic Earning**:
- 2 minutes of off-duty time per hour on duty
- Encourages longer duty sessions
- Stacks with performance bonuses

## üõ°Ô∏è **Inventory Management**

### Inventory Storage System

#### On Duty Activation
```java
// Automatic process when going on duty
1. Serialize current inventory
2. Store in database cache
3. Clear player inventory
4. Give appropriate guard kit
5. Apply duty restrictions
```

#### Off Duty Restoration
```java
// Automatic process when going off duty
1. Remove all guard kit items
2. Restore original inventory
3. Clear database cache
4. Remove duty restrictions
```

### Guard Kit System

#### Kit Configuration
```yaml
guard-system:
  kit-mappings:
    trainee: "trainee_kit"
    private: "private_kit"
    officer: "officer_kit"
    sergeant: "sergeant_kit"
    captain: "captain_kit"
    warden: "warden_kit"
```

#### Kit Integration
- **CMI Integration** - Automatic kit dispensing
- **Rank-based Kits** - Different equipment per rank
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Removes guard items when off duty

### Common Guard Kit Items
```yaml
# Automatically detected and managed
- DIAMOND_SWORD
- DIAMOND_HELMET
- DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE
- DIAMOND_LEGGINGS
- DIAMOND_BOOTS
- BOW

```yaml
guard-restrictions:
  block-mining: true      # Cannot mine blocks
  block-crafting: true    # Cannot craft items
  block-storage: true     # Cannot access chests
```

#### Item Management
- **No Item Dropping** - Prevents kit loss (except contraband compliance)
- **No Trading** - Cannot trade with other players
- **No Inventory Sharing** - Cannot share items

#### Movement Restrictions

## üåç **Region Integration**

### Required Regions

#### Guard Station
```yaml
guard-system:
  duty-region: "guard_station"
```

**Usage**:
- Required for duty activation
- Must be properly configured in WorldGuard
- Access controlled by guard permissions

#### Duty-Required Zones
```yaml
regions:
  duty-required-zones: "guard_lockers,guard_lockers2,guardplotstairs"
```

**Behavior**:
- Only on-duty guards can access
- Automatic restriction enforcement
- Configurable region list

#### Off-Duty Regions
**Valid Locations**:
- Guard station (same as on-duty)
- Any duty-required zone
- Configurable safe zones

### Region Configuration

```bash
# Create guard station
/rg define guard_station

# Set permissions
/rg flag guard_station entry -g guards allow
/rg flag guard_station entry deny

# Set additional flags
/rg flag guard_station pvp allow
/rg flag guard_station use allow
```

#### Integration Benefits
- **Automatic Enforcement** - Plugin handles region checking
- **Flexible Configuration** - Multiple valid regions
- **Security** - Prevents unauthorized access
