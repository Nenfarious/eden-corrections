## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Chase Mechanics**

### Chase Initiation

#### Prerequisites
```java
// Requirements for starting a chase
1. Guard must be on duty
2. Target must be wanted (level > 0)
3. Guard must be within max chase distance
4. Cannot exceed max concurrent chases
5. Guard cannot already be chasing someone
6. Target cannot already be chased
```

#### Command Usage
```bash
# Start chase with wanted player
/chase PlayerName

# Must be within initial distance
# Automatic validation of requirements
```

#### Process Flow
1. **Validation** - Check all prerequisites
2. **Initialization** - Create chase data entry
3. **Player Updates** - Set chase status for both players
4. **Notifications** - Alert guard and target
5. **Monitoring** - Start distance tracking

### Chase Monitoring

#### Distance Tracking
```yaml
chase:
  max-distance: 100      # Maximum chase distance
  warning-distance: 20   # Warning threshold
  max-concurrent: 3      # Server-wide chase limit
```

#### Automatic Monitoring
```java
// Every 5 seconds (configurable)
1. Check player locations
2. Calculate distance between guard and target
3. Send warnings if approaching limit
4. End chase if distance exceeded
5. Update chase statistics
```

#### Warning System
```java
// Distance warnings to guard
if (distance > warningDistance) {
    sendMessage(guard, "chase.warnings.distance", distancePlaceholder("distance", distance));
}
```

### Chase Termination

#### Automatic Termination
```java
// Chase ends automatically when:
1. Distance exceeds maximum limit
2. Chase duration expires
3. Either player disconnects
4. Target enters safe zone
5. Guard goes off duty
```

#### Manual Termination
```bash
# Guard can end chase manually
/chase end

# Admin can end specific chase
/corrections chase end GuardName

# Admin can end all chases
/corrections chase endall
```

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Combat Timer System**

### Combat Detection

#### Trigger Events
```java
// Combat timer starts when:
1. Player damages another player
2. Player takes damage from another player
3. Both players get combat timer
4. Duration resets on new combat
```

#### Configuration
```yaml
combat-timer:
  duration: 5                   # seconds
  prevent-capture: true         # block capture during combat
  prevent-teleport: true        # block teleportation
```

### Combat Restrictions

#### Capture Prevention
```java
// Cannot capture during combat
if (isInCombat(target) || isInCombat(guard)) {
    sendMessage(guard, "chase.restrictions.combat-timer-active");
    return false;
}
```

#### Teleportation Blocking
```java
// Block teleportation during combat
if (isInCombat(player)) {
    event.setCancelled(true);
    sendMessage(player, "combat.teleport-blocked");
}
```

#### Visual Indicators
```java
// Boss bar shows combat timer
showCountdownBossBar(player, "bossbar.combat-timer", 
    BossBar.Color.RED, BossBar.Overlay.PROGRESS, duration);

// Action bar notification
sendActionBar(player, "actionbar.combat-active");
```

### Combat Resolution

#### Timer Expiration
```java
// Combat timer ends automatically
1. Countdown reaches zero
2. Player disconnects
3. Player dies
4. Manual cancellation
```

#### Cleanup Process
```java
// When combat ends:
1. Remove combat timer data
2. Cancel countdown task
3. Hide boss bar
4. Send end message
5. Allow restricted actions
```

## üéØ **Capture Mechanics**

### Capture Requirements

#### Distance Validation
```java
// Must be within capture range
if (distance > 3.0) {
    sendMessage(guard, "chase.restrictions.capture-too-far");
    return false;
}
```

#### Combat Check
```java
// Cannot capture during combat
if (isInCombat(target) || isInCombat(guard)) {
    sendMessage(guard, "chase.restrictions.combat-timer-active");
    return false;
}
```

#### Chase Validation
```java
// Must be actively chasing target
ChaseData chase = getChaseByGuard(guard.getUniqueId());
if (chase == null || !chase.getTargetId().equals(target.getUniqueId())) {
    sendMessage(guard, "chase.restrictions.not-chasing-target");
    return false;
}
```

### Capture Process

#### Command Usage
```bash
# Capture during active chase
/chase capture

# Must be within 3 blocks of target
# Automatic validation and processing
```

#### Process Flow
1. **Validation** - Check all capture requirements
2. **Chase End** - Terminate active chase
3. **Jail Start** - Begin jail countdown process
4. **Notifications** - Alert both players
5. **Statistics** - Update performance metrics

#### Success Handling
```java
// Successful capture results
1. End active chase
2. Start jail countdown
3. Award performance bonus
4. Clear wanted level (after jail)
5. Update statistics
```

## üåç **Region Integration**

### Safe Zone Protection

#### No-Chase Zones
```yaml
regions:
  no-chase-zones: "safezone,visitor_area,medical_bay"
```

#### Behavior
```java
// Chase ends when target enters safe zone
if (isPlayerInSafeZone(target)) {
    endChase(chaseId, "Target entered safe zone");
    sendMessage(guard, "chase.end.safe-zone");
}
```

#### Zone Types
- **Safe Zones** - Complete chase immunity
- **Visitor Areas** - Civilian protection zones
- **Medical Bays** - Emergency protection areas
- **Admin Zones** - Staff-only areas

### Region Configuration

#### WorldGuard Setup
```bash
# Create safe zone
/rg define safezone

# Set chase immunity
/rg flag safezone custom-flag chase-immunity allow

# Configure region priorities
/rg priority safezone 10
```

#### Integration Benefits
- **Automatic Detection** - Plugin checks regions continuously
- **Flexible Configuration** - Multiple safe zone types
- **Fair Gameplay** - Balanced safe areas
